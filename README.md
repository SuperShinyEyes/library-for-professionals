## Preface
Hi, I'm Seyoung. I'm a product owner/manager at a tech startup. My background is in machine learning and computer vision, and I began my career as an engineer. With 12 years of coding experience, I still code for personal projects.

Over the years, I've educated myself on the theory and practices of business and management through video lectures, interviews, and books. Eventually, people began seeking my opinions on these topics. 

This is a general resource I've created to share my perspectives with anyone interested. I'm always interested in hearing your candid feedbackâ€”feel free to open an issue or send me an email.
